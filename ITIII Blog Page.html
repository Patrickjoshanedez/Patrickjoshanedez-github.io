            <p>This is the content of the blog entry about tree planting. Planting trees is not only a fun and wonderful activity, but it is also a very fulfilling experience. The laughter you share, the dirt beneath your nails, and the satisfaction you get from watching a sapling take root all contribute to a feeling of happiness and success that touches your soul.</p></p>

            <p>The second blog entry is about academic mentoring. It's a fun time learning new things from an upperclassman, as our mentor taught us how to code properly while using different techniques in applying the three types of loops in our program.</p>

            <p>The third blog entry is about face-to-face orientation where we're introduced to the school's regulation. It's a great opportunity to connect with peers and get valuable insights into the IT industry. And I have a chance to meet with my classmate in high school who is also attending the same college as me.</p>
