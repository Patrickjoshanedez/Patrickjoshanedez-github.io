          <h2>Artworks</h2>
          <p>I draw sometimes because I like to draw my favorite anime characters and it became a hobby ever since.</p>

          <div class="drawings">
              <img src="Assets/1d.jpg" alt="Drawing 1">
          </div>
          <p>This drawing is Raiden Shogun from Genshin Impact. I'm a fan of Japanese kimono and armor, so when I got her in-game, I simply cannot hold the urge to draw her. I mean, she's such a badass character after all and also does insane DPS in-game (:</p>

          <div class="drawings">
              <img src="Assets/2d.jpg" alt="Drawing 2">
          </div>
          <p>This is also one of my favorite characters in the manga/anime Jujutsu Kaisen. His character name is Toji Fushiguro, one of the coolest characters in the anime. He's got a cool physique, cool weapons (not a cool dad tho), but character design-wise, he's pretty good. That's why I drew him.</p>

          <div class="drawings">
              <img src="Assets/3d.jpg" alt="Drawing 3">
          </div>
          <p>This one is Garou from One punch man. I also liked him because of his insane powers and physique, the artist that drew him is Yusuke Murata whom I idolized so much, his artworks are one of a kind, the details are outstanding that's why I tried drawing one of his characters.</p>

          <div class="drawings">
              <img src="Assets/4d.jpg" alt="Drawing 4">
          </div>
          <p>I personally liked the aesthetics of this character. Her name is Makima or "The control demon" from the anime/manga Chainsaw Man. I also liked her because I like her character design.</p>

          <div class="drawings">
              <img src="Assets/5d.jpg" alt="Drawing 5">
          </div>
          <p>This is a model from Pinterest, I wanted to draw her because I want to improve my shading skills. I wasn't really impressed with the result though; it was decent, but it's hard work and it's worth it. I mean, I got to learn from my mistakes in order to grow. Overall, I'm proud of this one.</p>

          <div class="drawings">
              <img src="Assets/6d.jpg" alt="Drawing 6">
          </div>
          <p>This model is also from Pinterest; I don't remember her name, but she's a beautiful person with beautiful eyes and facial features. So, I also decided to draw her, and I think I did great on this one. Still has room for improvement though.</p>
